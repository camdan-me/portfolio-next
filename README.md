# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!
This is the repo that **powers my [personal website](https://camdan.me/)**. While previous iterations were closed-source, when I recently rewrote everything in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) I decided to open-source everything as well.
> This is a living project. It's not perfect or complete. I keep updating it and working on it regularly.

## Contributions
**This is a personal website.** The entire point is it showcases me. While I love ideas and input, this isn't the place for them- this is supposed to reflect me, not those around me. With that said, if you find a typo, bug, or usability issue please do [open an issue](https://github.com/camdan-me/portfolio-next/issues/new) to let me know.

## Development Flow
Everything on the `main` branch of this repository is automatically deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to [camdan.me](https://camdan.me). I do all of my work in the `development` branch, which is also automatically deployed to [beta.camdan.me](https://beta.camdan.me). When new features or critical bug fixes are ready, I simply merge them in to `main` with a pull request.

## Local Setup
If you want to run this locally, it's very simple. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download) and [Node](https://git-scm.com/download), then run the below commands:
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/camdan-me/portfolio-next.git
cd portfolio-next
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Once everything is done, you can access the site at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

## Getting in Touch
