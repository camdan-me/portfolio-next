# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!
This is the repo that **powers my [personal website](https://camdan.me/)**. While previous iterations were closed-source, when I recently rewrote everything in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) I decided to open-source everything as well.
> This is a living project. It's not perfect or complete. I keep updating it and working on it regularly.

## A Few Notes
As you review this repository, please keep the following in mind:

### Contributions
**This is a personal website.** The entire point is it showcases me. While I love ideas and input, this isn't the place for them- this is supposed to reflect me, not those around me. With that said, if you find a typo, bug, or usability issue please do [open an issue](https://github.com/camdan-me/portfolio-next/issues/new) to let me know.

### Development Flow
Everything on the `main` branch of this repository is automatically deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to [camdan.me](https://camdan.me). I do all of my work in the `development` branch, which is also automatically deployed to [beta.camdan.me](https://beta.camdan.me) though not accessible to the public. When new features or critical bug fixes are ready, I simply merge them in to `main` with a pull request.

### Other Projects
I have a bit of a network of personal websites, collected below:
- [birthday.camdan.me](https://birthday.camdan.me/example) How I celebrate birthdays. [View Repo](https://github.com/camdan-me/birthday)
- [cdn.camdan.me](https://cdn.camdan.me) Where I host any long-term public files. [View Repo](https://github.com/camdan-me/cdn)
- [haste.camdan.me](https://haste.camdan.me) My implementation of [HasteBin](https://github.com/toptal/haste-server). Only sort of maintained.
> More are coming soon, I have lots of stuff in the works.
